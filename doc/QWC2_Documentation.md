# QGIS Web Client 2 Documentation

## Introduction

QGIS Web Client 2 (QWC2) is a modular next generation responsive web client for QGIS Server, built with ReactJS and OpenLayers.

It is released under the terms of the [BSD license](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Requirements

As a minimum, a working QGIS server environment is required. Projects which are to be offered as QWC2 topics must be published as WMS.

Furthermore, a web server is required which will serve the QWC2 application.


## <a name="quick-start"></a>Quick start

QWC2 is divided into two repositories:

- The QWC2 components, hosted at [https://github.com/qgis/qwc2/](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2/). This repository contains the core building blocks common to all QWC2 applications.
- The QWC2 application, an example is hosted at [https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app). This repository contains the user-specific configuration of the core components and can also include any other custom components.

Additionally, some QWC2 components (such as permalink generation, elevation queries, editing, etc) require external services. The reference implementation of these services are hosted at [https://github.com/qwc-services/](https://github.com/qwc-services/).

To work with QWC2, you will need a minimal development environment consisting of [git](https://git-scm.com/), [node](https://nodejs.org/) and [yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com).

The fastest way to get started is by recursively cloning the demo application repository:

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app.git

Next, install all required dependencies:

    $ cd qwc2-demo-app
    $ yarn install

Then, start a local development application:

    $ yarn start

The development application will run by default on `http://localhost:8081`. Note: if you are behind a proxy server, you'll need to [specify the proxy settings](#themes-json).

At this point, you can customize and configure the application according to your needs, as described in detail in the following chapters.

The final step is to compile a deployable application bundle for production:

    $ yarn run prod

You can then deploy the contents of the `prod` folder to your web server root.

*Note*: On some Linux distributions, `yarn` may refer to the tool of the `cmdtest` software package, not the Yarn package manager. The latter might instead be called `yarnpkg`.


## QWC2 configuration

The layout of the development tree is as follows:

These files are described in detail in the following sections, in order of importance.

### Application configuration: the `config.json` and `js/appConfig.js` files

The central aspect to keep in mind is that a QWC2 application consists of a collection of plugins, which can be individually enabled and configured, in particular separately for desktop and mobile mode. Together, the `config.json` and `js/appConfig.js` files control these plugins, along with a number of other global settings.

The `js/appConfig.js` is the build-time configuation file, and defines:
- The default application locale, built into the application. This locale is used if no available locale matches the browser locale.
- Which plugins are built into the application. Plugins left out here will be completely omitted when compiling the application bundle, and will hence also reduce the size of the bundle.
- Various hook functions, as documented in the sample [sample `js/appConfig.js`](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/js/appConfig.js).

The `config.json` file is the run-time configuration file. It contains the following settings:

*URLs of external services*:
Some external services can be used to enhance the application. The reference implementation of these services are hosted at [https://github.com/qwc-services/](https://github.com/qwc-services/). The following services can be configured:

| Setting              | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
|`permalinkServiceUrl` | Generates and resolves compact permalinks for the Share plugin. If empty, the full URL will be used. |
|`elevationServiceUrl` | Returns elevation values, used to generate a height profile when measuring lines and display elevation information in the map right-click information bubble. If empty, the respective information will not be displayed in the client. |
|`editServiceUrl`      | Service for editing features of layers served by QGIS Server. See [Editing](#editing). |
|`mapInfoService`      | Returns additional information to be displayed in the map right-click information bubble. If empty, no additional information will be displayed. |
|`featureReportService`| Returns a custom document associated to a feature. See [`themesConfig.json`](#themesConfig-json). |

*Global settings*:

All settings are optional, with fallback to the default values as documented.

| Setting                             | Description |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|
|`translationsPath`                   | Path from to the `translations` folder. Default value: `translations`.   |
|`assetsPath`                         | Path from to the `assets` folder. Default value: `assets`.               |
|`urlPositionFormat`                  | How to encode the current map extent in the URL, either `centerAndZoom` or `extent`. See [URL parameters](#url-parameters) for details. Default value: `extent`. |
|`urlPositionCrs`                     | The CRS used to encode the current map extent coordinates in the URL. Default value: the map projection. |
|`omitUrlParameterUpdates`            | Whether to omit updating the URL parameters. Default value: `false`.      |
|`defaultFeatureStyle`                | The default style to use for selection geometries and other unstyled features. Default value: see `qwc2/utils/FeatureStyles.js`. |
|`projections`                        | A list of map projections to register, in the format `{"code": "<code>", "proj": "<proj4def>", "label": "<label>"}`. By default, `EPSG:3857` and `EPSG:4326` are registered. |
|`allowFractionalZoom`                | Whether to allow arbitrary scales for viewing the map. Default value: `false`.      |
|`localeAwareNumbers`                 | Whether to use locale aware numbers throughout. Default value: `false`.             |
|`wmsDpi`                             | The DPI to pass to the WMS requests. Default value: `96`.                           |
|`wmsHidpi`                           | Whether to honour the device pixel ratio for WMS GetMap requests. Default value: `true`. |
|`qgisServerVersion`                  | The QGIS Server major version in use, i.e. `3`.|
|`externalLayerFeatureInfoFormats`    | A dictionary of feature info formats for external layers, in the format `{"<url>": "<format>", ...}`. If the GetFeatureInfo URL of a layer contains the specified `<url>`, the corresponding format is used. |
|`storeAllLayersInPermalink`          | Whether to store the full layertree in the permalink data, rather than only local (i.e. redlining) layers. If false, remote layers are re-queried from the respective services, if true, they are statically reloaded (meaning restored layers may be outdated compared to current service capabilities).

*Global settings, overridable per theme*:<a name="config-json-overridable"></a>

The following options can be specified globally, and also overriden per theme, see [`themesConfig.json`](#themesConfig-json).
All settings are optional, with fallback to the default values as documented.

| Setting                              | Description |
|--------------------------------------|-------------|
|`preserveExtentOnThemeSwitch`         | Whether to preserve the current map extent when switching theme, if possible (see below). Default value: `false`. |
|`preserveBackgroundOnThemeSwitch`     | Whether to preserve the current background layer when switching theme, if possible. Default value: `false`. |
|`preserveNonThemeLayersOnThemeSwitch` | Whether to preserve non-theme layers when switching theme. Default value: `false`.  |
|`allowReorderingLayers`               | Whether to allow re-ordering layers in the layer tree. Default value: `false`.      |
|`flattenLayerTreeGroups`              | Whether to display a flat layer tree, omitting the groups. Default value: `false`.  |
|`allowLayerTreeSeparators`            | Allows users to add separator items in a flat layer tree. Default value: `false`.   |
|`preventSplittingGroupsWhenReordering`| Whether to prevent splitting sibling groups or the group itself when reordering items. Default value: `false`. |
|`allowRemovingThemeLayers`            | Whether to allow removing any theme layers from the layer tree. Default value: `false`. |
|`searchThemes`                        | Whether allow searching for themes from the global search field. Default value: `false`. |
|`allowAddingOtherThemes`              | Whether to allow adding another theme to a currently loaded theme. Default value: `false`. |
|`disableImportingLocalLayers`         | Whether to hide the option to import local layers from the layer tree. Default value: `false`. |
|`importLayerUrlPresets`               | A list of predefined URLs from which the user can choose when importing layers from the layer tree. Entries must be strings or objects of the format `{"label": "<Label>", "value": "<URL>"}`. See also [Layer catalogs](#layer-catalogs). |
|`identifyTool`                        | The name of the identify plugin to use. It is possible to have multiple identify tools, and i.e. on a per-theme basis select which one is active. Default value: `Identify`. |
|`globallyDisableDockableDialogs`      | Whether to globally disable the dockable feature of popup dialogs. Default value: `false`. |

*Notes*:

- The layer tree supports re-ordering layers via drag-and-drop if `allowReorderingLayers = true` *and either* `preventSplittingGroupsWhenReordering = true` *or* `flattenLayerTreeGroups = true`.
- If `preserveExtentOnThemeSwitch = true`, the current extent is preserved if it is within the new theme extent and if the current theme map projection is equal to the new theme projection. If `preserveExtentOnThemeSwitch = "force"`, the current extent is preserved regardless of whether it is within the new theme extent, but the current and new theme map projections must still match.

*Plugin configuration*:
The plugin configuration is entered separately for desktop and for mobile mode. Refer to the [sample `config.json`](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/static/config.json) for a list of available configuration options. Each plugin configuration block is of the format

    {
      "name": "<PluginName">,
      "cfg": {
        ...
      },
      "mapClickAction": <"identify"|"unset"|null>
    }

where

* `name`: The plugin name
* `cfg`: Optional: arbitrary configuration properties, directly passed to the relative plugin class as React props.
* `mapClickAction`: Optional: for plugins which are associated to a viewer task (and typically linked in the `menuItems` or `toolbarItems` of the `TopBar`, see below), determines whether a click in the map will result in the identify tool being invoked, the task being unset, or whether no particular action should be performed (default). Note: `"mapClickAction"` should be `null` or omitted for plugins which handle mouse events on the map themselves. Can optionally also be specified directly in the `menuItems` or `toolbarItems` entries, see below.

You can omit a plugin entry to disable it in desktop and/or mobile mode. To completely remove a plugin from the compiled application, remove the corresponding entry in `js/appConfig.js`.

A particularly interesting aspect is the configuration of the entries in the application menu and toolbar, i.e. the entries in `menuItems` and `toolbarItems` in the `TopBar` configuration. The most common format for linking an entry to an existing plugin is

    {"key": "<key>", "icon": "<icon>", "themeWhitelist": ["<themename>", ...], "mapClickAction": <"identify"|"unset"|null>, "mode": "<mode>", "requireAuth": <true|false>}

where

* `key`: The name of the plugin to activate when the entry is clicked, i.e. `LayerTree`. Also used to lookup the label for the entry from the translations, using the `appmenu.items.<key>` message identifier (see <a href="#translations">Managing translations</a>).
* `icon`: The icon of the entry, either a name (without the `.svg` extension) of an icon in `icons/`, or `:/<path_to_asset>` containing the path relative to `assetsPath` of an asset image.
* `themeWhitelist`: Optional, allows specifying a whitelist of theme names or titles for which the entry should be visible.
* `mapClickAction`: Optional, takes precedence over the `mapClickAction` setting specified in the plugin configuration block, if any. See above.
* `mode`: Optional, depending on the plugin, a mode can be configured to launch the plugin directly in a specific mode. For instance, the `Measure` plugin supports specifying the measurement mode (`Point`, `LineString`, `Polygon`).
* `requireAuth`: Optional, the entry is only visible when user is logged-in when true (works with qwc-services).

Additionally, entries opening external URLs can be defined as follows:

    {"key": "<key>", "icon": "<icon>", "url": "<url>", "target": "<target>"}

where

* `Key`: An arbitrary key name (not used by existing plugins), used to lookup the label for the entry from the translations.
* `icon`: As above.
* `url`: The URL to open. Can contain as placeholders the keys listed in <a href="#url-parameters">URL parameters</a>, encolsed in `$` (i.e. `$e$` for the extent). In addition, the placeholders `$x$` and `$y$` for the individual map center coordinates are also supported.
* `target`: The target where to open the URL, if empty, `_blank` is assumed. Can be `iframe` to open the link in a iframe window inside QWC2.



### Theme configuration: QGIS projects and the `themesConfig.json` file

A theme corresponds to a QGIS project, published as WMS and served by QGIS Server.

#### Creating and publishing a QGIS project

The first step is to prepare a QGIS project. Besides the common tasks of adding and grouping layers, the following table gives an overview of settings which influence how the theme is displayed by QWC2:

| What                 | Where                                     | Description                                      |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Service capabilities | Project Properties &rarr; QGIS Server &rarr; Service capabilities | **Must** be checked for QGIS Server to publish the project. |
| Service Metadata     | Project Properties &rarr; QGIS Server &rarr; Service capabilities | Shown in the theme info dialog, invokable from the Layer Tree panel titlebar. |
| Title, keywords      | Project Properties &rarr; QGIS Server &rarr; Service capabilities | Theme title, displayed in the Theme Switcher, and keywords, useful for filtering. |
| Queryable layers     | Project Properties &rarr; Data sources | Mark layers as identifyable by the client.       |
| FeatureInfo geometry | Project Properties &rarr; QGIS Server &rarr; WMS Capabilities &rarr; Add geometry to feature response | Return feature geometries with the GetFeatureInfo request. Allows the client to highlight the selected features. |
| Layer Display Field  | Vector Layer Properties &rarr; Display    | The field used in the identify results. |
| Layer Map Tip        | Vector Layer Properties &rarr; Display    | The contents of the Map Tip shown when hovering over layers in the client, if displaying Map Tips is enabled in the Layer Tree. |
| Layer Metadata       | Layer Properties &rarr; QGIS Server       | Shown in the client Layer Info dialog, invokable from the Layer Tree. |
| Scale range          | Layer Properties &rarr; Rendering &rarr; Scale dependent visibility | The scale range within which a layer is visible, useful to improve rendering performance. |
| Initial visibility   | Layers Panel                              | Initial visibility of layers and groups.         |
| Rendering order      | Layer Order Panel or Layers Panel         | Rendering order of the layers. If layer re-ordering is enabled in `config.json`, the order from the Layer Order Panel is ignored. |
| Print layouts        | Layout manager                            | The print layouts offered in the Print plugin.   |
| Print layout labels  | Layout manager                            | Print layout labels with an ID will be exposed in the Print plugin. Note: a label ID starting with `__` will not be exposed. |

#### <a name="themesConfig-json"></a>Configuring the themes in `themesConfig.json`

The second step is to configure the themes which are available to QWC2 in the `themesConfig.json` file, which contains a list of themes, optionally organized in groups, as well as a list of background layers:

    {
      "themes": {
        "items": [
          { <ThemeDefinition> },
          ...
        ], "groups": [
          {
            "title": <Group title>,
            "items": [{ <ThemeDefinition> }, ...],
            "groups": [ { <Group> }, ...]
           },
           ...
        ]
      },
      "externalLayers": [
        { <ExternalLayerDefinition> },
        ...
      ],
      "themeInfoLinks": [
        { <ThemeInfoLinkDefinition> },
        ...
      ],
      "backgroundLayers": [
        { <BackgroundLayerDefinition> },
        ...
      ],
      "defaultScales": [<Scale denominators>],
      "defaultPrintScales" [<Scale denominators>],
      "defaultPrintResolutions": [<DPIs>],
      "defaultPrintGrid": [<Print grid, see below>]
    }

Refer to the [sample `themesConfig.json`](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/themesConfig.json) for a complete example.

The format of the theme definitions is as follows:
<!-- Important: Use U+00A0 non-breaking spaces ( ) in code blocks -->
| Entry                                        | Description                                                                       |

| `"attribution": "<Attribution>",`            | Optional, attribution which will be shown in the bottom right corner of the map.  |
| `"attributionUrl": "<URL>",`                 | Optional, link associated to the attribution                                      |
| `"default": true,`                           | Whether to use this theme as initial theme                                        |

**External layers:**
External layers can be used to selectively replace layers in a QGIS project, for instance in the case of a WMS layer embedded in a QGIS project, to avoid cascading WMS requests. They are handled transparently by QWC2 (they are positioned in the layer tree identically to the internal layer they replace), but the `GetMap` and `GetFeatureInfo` requests are sent directly to the specified WMS Service.

The format for external layer definitions is as follows:

| Entry                                                  | Description                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `"name": "<external_layer_name>",`                     | The name of the external layer, as referenced in the theme definitions.           |
| `"type": "<layer_type>",`                              | Layer type, "wms" or "wmts"                                                       |
| `"url": "<wms_baseurl>",       `                       | The WMS URL or WMTS resource URL for the external layer.                          |

For external WMS layers, the following additional parameters apply:

| Entry                                                  | Description                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `"params": {`                                          | Parameters for the GetMap request.                                                |
| `  "LAYERS": "<wms_layername>,..."`,                   | WMS layer names.                                                                  |
| `  "OPACITIES": "<0-255>,..."`                         | Optional, if WMS server supports opacities.                                       |
| `},`                                                   |                                                                                   |
| `"featureInfoUrl": "<wms_featureinfo_baseurl>",`       | Optional, base URL for WMS GetFeatureInfo, if different from `url`.               |
| `"legendUrl": "<wms_legendgraphic_baseurl>"   ,`       | Optional, base URL for WMS GetLegendGraphic, if different from `url`.             |
| `"queryLayers": ["<wms_featureinfo_layername>", ...],` | Optional, list of GetFeatureInfo query layers, if different from `params.LAYERS`. |
| `"infoFormats": ["<featureinfo_format>", ...]`         | List of GetFeatureInfo query formats which the WMS service supports.              |

For external WMTS layers, the following additional parameters apply (you can use the `qwc2/scripts/wmts_config_generator.py` script to obtain these values):

| Entry                                                  | Description                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `"tileMatrixSet": "<tile_matrix_set_name>",`           | The name of the tile matrix set.                                                  |
| `"originX": <origin_x>,`                               | The X origin of the tile matrix.                                                  |
| `"originY": <origin_y>,`                               | The Y origin of the tile matrix.                                                  |
| `"projection": "EPSG:<code>",`                         | The layer projection.                                                             |
| `"resolutions": [<resolution>, ...],`                  | The list of WMTS resolutions.                                                     |
| `"tileSize": [<tile_width>, <tile_height>]`            | The tile width and height.                                                        |

You can also set the "Data Url" for a layer in QGIS (Layer Properties &rarr; QGIS Server &rarr; Data Url) to a string of the form

    wms:<service_url>?<options>#<layername>

(for instance, `wms:http://wms.geo.admin.ch?tiled=false#ch.are.bauzonen`), and an external layer pointing to the specified WMS service will automatically be created for the corresponding QGIS layer.
Note that this is currently only implemented for WMS layers.


**Theme info links:**
You can specify links to display in an info-menu next to the respective theme title in the theme switcher entries.

The format for the theme info links is as follows:

| Entry                                                  | Description                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `"name": "<link_name>",`                               | The name of the link, as referenced in the theme definitions.                     |
| `"title": "<link_title>",`                             | The title for the link, as displayed in the info menu of the theme entry in the theme switcher. |
| `"url": "<link>",`                                     | A link URL.                                                                       |
| `"target": "<link_target>"`                            | The link target, i.e. `_blank`.                                                   |


**Background layers:**
Background layers are handled completely client-side and do not appear in the layer tree.

The format of the background layer definitions is as follows:

| Entry                                 | Description                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `"name": "<Name>",`                   | The name of the background layer, used in the theme definitions.                  |
| `"title": "<Title>",`                 | The title of the background layer, as displayed in the background switcher.       |
| `"titleMsgId": "<Menu title msgID>",` | Alternative to `title`, a message ID, translated through the translation files.  |
| `"thumbnail": "<Filename>",`          | Optional, image file in `assets/img/mapthumbs`. Defaults to `default.jpg`.        |
| `"type": "<Type>",`                   | The background layer type, i.e. `wms` or `wmts`.                                  |
| `"group":  "<GroupId>",`              | Optional, a group ID string. Background layers with the same group ID will be grouped together in the background switcher. |
| `"minScale": <min_scale>,`            | Optional, minimum scale denominator from which to render the layer.               |
| `"maxScale": <max_scale>,`            | Optional, maximum scale denominator from which to render the layer.               |
| `<Layer params>`                      | Parameters according to the specified layer type. Refer to the [sample `themesConfig.json`](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/themesConfig.json) for some examples. |

*Note*: You can use the helper python script located at `qwc2/scripts/wmts_config_generator.py` to easily generate WMTS background layer configurations.

Alternatively, a background layer definition can be a group of layers, in the format

    {
      "name": "<Name>",
      "title": "<Title>",
      "type": "group",
      "items": [
        { <BackgroundLayerDefinition> },
        { <BackgroundLayerDefinition> },
        ...
      ]
    }

Instead of specifiying a full background layer definition in a group, you can also reference an existing one with `"ref": "<bg_layer_name>"`, and selectively override certain properties, such as `minScale` and `maxScale`:

    {
      ...
      "items": [
        {
          "ref": "<bg_layer_name>",
          "minScale": <min_scale>,
          "maxScale": <max_scale>
        },
        ...
      ]
    }

#### <a name="themes-json"></a>Generating `themes.json`

The final step is to generate `themes.json`, the file which is ultimately read by QWC2. This file combines the input from `themesConfig.json` with the information from the WMS service capabilities and is automatically generated when starting the local development application via `yarn start`. Alternatively, it can be manually generated via

    yarn run themesconfig

or, if working in an environment without node, using the equivalent command

    python3 qwc2/scripts/themesConfig.py


If you want to manage multiple `themesConfig.json` files, you can specify which while should be processed by the theme generation script via the `QWC2_THEMES_CONFIG` environment variable.

Note: if you are behind a proxy server and your `themesConfig.json` refers to resources outside the local network, you'll need to specify the proxy settings to use in `themesConfig.json` by adding a toplevel block of the form

    {
      "proxy": {
          "host": "<host>",
          "port": <port>,
          "auth": {
              "username": "<username>",
              "password": "<password>"
        }
      },
      "themes": {...},
      ...
    }

### Implementing search providers in `js/SearchProviders.js`

Search providers are typically application specific, and hence need to be implemented in the application specific `js/SearchProviders.js` file. The [sample `js/SearchProviders.js`](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/js/SearchProviders.js) documents how to implement search providers and contains some examples.

An advanced feature is the possibility to define parametrized search providers. This allows for instance to implement just a generic search provider interface in `js/SearchProviders.js` and move the implementation details to the service. To this end, you can also add to the `searchProviders` list in `themesConfig.json` entries of the form

    {key: <Key>, label: <Label>, ...}

Such entries are passed to the method `searchProviderFactory` in `js/SearchProviders.js`, which you can tweak to dynamically create a search provider definition based on the parameters specified in the entry. Refer to the [sample  `js/SearchProviders.js`](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/js/SearchProviders.js) for an example.

### <a name="editing"></a>Editing support

QWC2 offers comprehensive editing support through a variety of plugins:

- The `Editing` plugin allows creating, editing and removing features of an editable vector layer. It supports editing both geometry and attributes, displaying customizeable attribute forms.
- The `AttributeTable` plugin also allows creating, editing and removing features of an editable vector layer. It displays all features of the editable layer in a tabularized view, and allows editing attributes, but not geometries.
- The `FeatureForm` works similarly to the feature-info, but also allows editing the attributes and geometry of a picked feature. It can be used as `identifyTool` instead of the standard `Identify` plugin.

To configure editing in QWC2, you need to follow the following steps:

- Set up an editing backend. You can use the readily available [QWC data service](https://github.com/qwc-services/qwc-data-service), or a custom backend.
- Enable the desired editing plugins in `appConfig.js`. If you use a custom editing backend, you'll most likely need to implement a custom editing interface and specify it in `appConfig.json`, see the comment above `EditingPlugin` in [`js/appConfig.js`](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/js/appConfig.js).
- If you are using qwc-services, the [QWC config generator](https://github.com/qwc-services/qwc-config-generator) and [QWC map viewer](https://github.com/qwc-services/qwc-map-viewer) will automatically generate a suitable `editConfig` for each editable layer and embed it in the `themes.json`, otherwise you need to write a custom `editConfig` in `themesConfig.json` as described below.

As a backend, you can use the readily available [QWC data service](https://github.com/qwc-services/qwc-data-service). Please consult its README detailed information including how to set up the edit forms.

If you use a custom backend, you will need to implement a corresponding editing interface in `js/EditingInterface.js`.

If you don't use the [QWC config generator](https://github.com/qwc-services/qwc-config-generator) and [QWC map viewer](https://github.com/qwc-services/qwc-map-viewer), you will also need to write the `editConfig` block in `themesConfig.json` as follows:

| Entry                                | Description                                                   |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `{`                                  |                                                               |
| `  <LayerId>: {`                     | A WMS layer ID. Should be a theme WMS layer name, to ensure the WMS is correctly refreshed. |
| `    "layerName": "<LayerName>",`    | The layer name to show in the selection combo box. |
| `    "editDataset": "<DatasetName>",`| The name of the edit dataset passed to the editing interface. |
| `    "geomType": "<GeomType>",`      | The geometry type, either `Point`, `LineString` or `Polygon`. |
| `    "displayField":  "<FieldId>",`  | The ID of the field to use in the feature selection menu.     |
| `    "permissions": {`               | A list of different write permissions to specify rights and buttons. |
| `      "creatable": <boolean>,`      | If `true`, `Draw` button will appear in Editing interface and `Add` button in Attribute Table. |
| `      "updatable": <boolean>,`      | If `true`, `Pick` button will appear in Editing interface.    |
| `      "deletable": <boolean>,`      | If `true`, `Delete` button will appear in Editing interface and Attribute Table. |
| `      },`                           |                                                               |
| `    "fields": [{`                   | A list of field definitions, for each exposed attribute.      |
| `      "id": "<FieldID>",`           | The field ID.                                                 |
| `      "name": "<FieldName>",`       | The field name, as displayed in the editing form.             |
| `      "type": "<FieldType>",`       | A field type. Either `bool`, `list` or a regular [HTML input element type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input). |
| `      "constraints": {`             | Constraints for the input field.                              |
| `        "values": [<Entries>],`     | Only if `type` is `list`: an array of arbitrary strings.      |
| `        ...`                        | For regular HTML input types, the ReactJS API name of any applicable [HTML input constraint](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input), i.e. `maxLength` or `readOnly`. |
| `      }`                            |                                                               |
| `    }],`                            |                                                               |
| `    "form": "<PathToUiFile>",`      | As alternative to `fields`, a QtDesigner UI file. See below.  |
| `  }`                                |                                                               |
| `}`                                  |                                                               |

* If you specify `fields`, a simple form is autogenerated based on the field definitions.
* If you specify `form`, you can specify the URL to a Qt Designer UI form (use `:/<path>` to specify a path below the `assets` folder). Most basic input elements provided by QtDesigner are supported, see [this sample form](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/assets/forms/form.ui). The widget names must be set equal to the attribute names.

See the [sample `editConfig.json`](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/test2056_edit.json) for a full example.

### <a name="snapping"></a>Snapping support

QWC2 ships a plugin for snapping support while drawing (redlining / measuring / editing). To enable it, make sure the `SnappingSupport` plugin is enabled in `appConfig.js` (see the sample [sample `js/appConfig.js`](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/js/appConfig.js)). Then, for each theme for which you want snapping to be available, you can add a `snapping` block to your theme item in `themesConfig.json` as follows:

    ...
    "snapping": {
      "snaplayers": [
        {
          "name": "<layername>",
          "min": <min_scale>
          "max": <max_scale>
        }
      ],
      "featureCount": <feature_count>
    }
    ...

where:

- `layername` is the name of the theme sublayer from which to retreive the snapping geometries
- `min` is the minimum scale denominator (inclusive) from which this layer should be used for snapping
- `max` is the maximum scale denominator (exclusive) up to which this layer should be used for snapping
- `feature_count` is the maximum number of snapping geometries to retreive for the current map extent (default: 500).

Snapping works by querying the geometries of all snapping layers inside the scale range via WMS GetFeatureInfo and refreshing the geometries every time the map extent changes. Therefore, it is recommended to ensure the geometry complexity of the snap layers is appropriate for the specified scale ranges to avoid overloading the server with the GetFeatureInfo requests. Also, the QGIS project will need to be configured to add geometries to the feature info responses.

For the `Redlining`, `Measure` and `Editing` plugins, the availability of snapping can be independently configured:

    {
      "name":"<Redlining|Measure|Editing>",
      "cfg": {
        "snapping": <true|false>,
        "snappingActive": <true|false>,
        ...
      }
    }

where:

- `snapping` determines whether snapping is available for the specified plugin
- `snappingActive` determines whether snapping is active by default for the specified plugin

When snapping is available, a small toolbar appears on the bottom border of the map with the possibility to toggle snapping.

### <a name="translations"></a>Managing translations

The translations are managed on two levels:

- At QWC2 components level, in `qwc2/translations`.
- At application level, in `translations`.

A script will take care of merging the component translations into the application translations. This way, when updating the QWC2 submodule, new translations are automatically obtained. This script is automatically invoked on `yarn start`, but can also be manually invoked using

    yarn run tsupdate

Translations are stored inside the respective `translations` folder as regular plain-text JSON files, named `<locale>.json` and can be freely edited with any text editor.

The `tsconfig.json` files stored inside the respective `translations` folder contains the list of languages for which translations should be generated and a list of message IDs to include in the translation. The `tsupdate` script will automatically scan for message IDs (looking for static strings passed to `LocaleUtils.tr` and `LocaleUtils.trmsg`), store these in `tsconfig.json` and automatically create resp. update the translation files.

In some cases `tsconfig.json` will not pick up a message ID (for instance, if it is computed at runtime). In these cases, the message IDs can be added manually to the `extra_strings` section of the `tsconfig.json`.

Also it may be desired to override a translation inherited from the QWC2 components at application level. To prevent `tsupdate` from continuously reverting the overridden translation, the respective message IDs can be added to the `overrides` section in the application `tsconfig.json` file.

The typical workflow for managing application translations is:

- Declare all locales which should be supported in `js/appConfig.js`.
- Ensure these locales are listed in `translations/tsconfig.json`.
- Write the translated strings to the respective `<locale>.json` files.
- Test the translation, specifying `lang=<locale>` in the QWC2 application URL.

If translations of the QWC2 components for a desired language are missing, please create resp. update the translations respective files in `qwc2/translations` and contribute them by submitting a pull request to the [upstream qwc2 repository](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2).

### <a name="appearance-customization"></a>Customizing the QWC2 appearance

The following options are available for customizing the appearance of the QWC2 application while preserving compatibility with the core QWC2 components:

- Modifying the logo in `assets/img/`.
- Modifying the application icons in `icons`.
- Tweaking the colors in `styleConfig.js`.
- Adding style declarations to the master CSS stylesheet `assets/css/qwc2.css`. This however is potentially fragile and should only be done as a last resort.
- Changing the browser page title in `index.html`, and potentially adding a favicon.
- Modifying the legend print template in `assets/templates/legendprint.html`. The only requirement for this template is that is must contain a `<div id="legendcontainer"></div>` element.
- Modifying the custom Help component `js/Help.jsx`.

*Note*: The common application icons are located in `qwc2/icons`. They can be overridden by creating an icon with the same filename in the application specific `icons` folder.
*Note*: The icons in the `icons` folder are compiled into an icon font. Currently, the icons need to be black content on transparent background, and all drawings (including texts) must be converted to paths for the icons to render correctly.


## Server-side configuration
### <a name="cross-origin-requests"></a>Cross-Origin requests
All modern browsers will block a page from requesting resources from another origin (except for images, stylesheets, scripts, iframes and videos), unless the response from the remote origin contains a matching `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. An origin is defined as `<scheme>://<hostname>:<port>`.

For each service QWC2 interacts with, in particular the QGIS Server, one has to ensure that this interaction isn't blocked by the browser. The following options exist:

- Ensure that the service runs on the same origin as the web server which serves the QWC2 application.
- Ensure that the service sends a `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header with matching origin with each response.
- For development purposes, use a browser plugin which adds the CORS headers, i.e. [CORS Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/).

### Filenames of print and raster and DXF export
The QGIS server response for the print, raster and DXF export requests does by default not contain any `Content-Disposition` header, meaning that browsers will attempt to guess a filename, which typically is the last part of the URL, without any extension.

To ensure browsers use a proper filename, configure the web server running QGIS Server to add a suitable `Content-Disposition` header to the response. In the case of Apache, the rule for the print output might look as follows:

    SetEnvIf Request_URI "^/wms.*/(.+)$" project_name=$1
    Header always setifempty Content-Disposition "attachment; filename=%{project_name}e.pdf" "expr=%{CONTENT_TYPE} = 'application/pdf'"

This rule will use the last part of the URL as basename and add the `.pdf` extension, and will also ensure that the content-type is set to `application/pdf`. Note that this example uses the `setenvif` and `headers` apache modules.

## <a name="url-parameters"></a>URL parameters
The following parameters can appear in the URL of the QWC2 application:

- `t`: The active theme
- `l`: The layers in the map, see below.
- `bl`: The visible background layer
- `st`: The search text
- `sp`: Applied search provider when using `st` Parameter
- `e`: The visible extent
- `c`: The center of the visible extent
- `s`: The current scale
- `crs`: The CRS of extent/center coordinates
- `hc`: If `c` is specified and `hc` is `true` or `1`, a marker is set at `c` when starting the application. Note: requires the `StartupMarkerPlugin` plugin to be active.

The `l` parameter lists all layers in the map (redlining and background layers) as a comma separated list of entries of the form

    <layername>[<transparency>]!

where
- `layername` is the WMS name of a theme layer or group, or a string of the format

      <wms|wfs>:<service_url>#<layername>?<options>
   for external layers, i.e. `wms:https://wms.geo.admin.ch#ch.are.bauzonen?tiled=true`.
- `<transparency>` denotes the layer transparency, betwen 0 and 100. If the `[<transparency>]` portion is omitted, the layer is fully opaque.
- `!` denotes that the layer is invisible. If omitted, the layer is visible. If the layer is visible in an invisible parent group, `~` is used.

*Note*: If group name is specified instead of the layer name, QWC2 will automatically resolve this to all layer names contained in that group, and will apply transparency and visibility settings as specified for the group.

The `urlPositionFormat` parameter in `config.json` determines whether the extent or the center and scale appears in the URL.

The `urlPositionCrs` parameter in `config.json` determines the projection to use for the extent resp. center coordinates in the URL. By default the map projection of the current theme is used. If `urlPositionCrs` is equal to the map projection, the `crs` parameter is omitted in the URL.

If the search text passed via `st` results in a unique result, the viewer automatically zooms to this result on startup. If the search result does not provide a bounding box, the `minScaleDenom` defined in the `searchOptions` of the `TopBar` configuration in `config.json` is used.

## Startup position
By default, the viewer opens zooming on the respective theme extent, as defined in `themes.json` (and overrideable in `themesConfig.json`).

Alternatively, the following three options exist to influence the startup position:

- Pass appropriate `c`, `s` or `e` URL parameters, as documented in [URL parameters](#url-parameters).
- Pass a search text which results in a unique result (i.e. a coordinate string) as URL parameter, as documented in [URL parameters](#url-parameters).
- Set `startupMode` in the `LocateSupport` options of the `Map` configuration in `config.json`. Possible values are `DISABLED`, `ENABLED` or `FOLLOWING`. If a search text is passed via `st` URL parameter or `hc=1` is specified in the URL, the `startupMode` is ignored.

## <a name="layer-catalogs"></a>Layer catalogs
The import layer functionality in the layertree also supports loading a layer catalog document from an URL. Two catalog formats are supported:

* QGIS WMS/WFS connections XML: this file is produced by exporting the configured WMS or WFS connections from the QGIS data source manager dialog.
* JSON: a document with contents

      {
        "catalog": [
          {
            "title": "<Titel>",
            "resource": "<wms|wfs>:<service_url>#<layername>"
          },
          ...
        ]
      }

  where `resource` is in the same format as the serialized layer identifiers in a QWC2 URL, see [URL Parameters](#url-parameters).

Note that the server serving the catalog documents needs to ensure that it sets CORS headers appropriately, if they are served from a different origin than QWC2.

## Links in identify results

Links in attributes of GetFeatureInfo reponses are parsed and displayed as clickable links in the identify results window. You can also have links open in an inline dialog using the following format:

    <a href="<url>" target=":iframedialog:<name>:<option1=value1>:<option2=value2>:...">Text</a>

Where:

* `name` The name of the dialog. All links with the same name will open in the same dialog (resp. re-use an already visible dialog). Note that the title of the window will be the translation message ID `windows.<name>`, which should be added to `extra_strings` in `tsconfig.json` and translated in the respective language files.
* Supported options include:
  - `width=<integer>`: Initial window width
  - `height=<integer>`: Initial window height
  - `print=<boolean>`: Whether to display a print icon in the window title bar
  - `dockable=<boolean>`: Whether the window is dockable
  - `docked=<boolean>`: Whether the window is initially docked


## Keeping the QWC2 application up to date
As mentioned in the [quick start](#quick-start) chapter, QWC2 is split into a common components repository and an application specific repository. The goal of this approach is to cleanly separate user-specific configuration and components which common components which serve as a basis for all QWC2 applications, and to make it as easy as possible to rebase the application onto the latest common QWC2 components.

The recommended workflow is to keep the `qwc2` folder a submodule referencing the [upstream qwc2 repository](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2). To update it, just checkout the latest master (or a specific commit if desired):

    cd qwc2
    git checkout master
    git pull
    cd ..
    yarn install

It is good practice to run `yarn install` after pulling the submodule to ensure all the correct dependencies are installed.

The [upgrade notes](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/UpgradeNotes.md) documents major changes, and in particular all incompatible changes between releases which require changes to the application specific code and/or configuration.

## API for external applications
The API plugin binds many application actions to the `window.qwc2` object and makes them accessible for external applications. Currently, the following methods are available:

- All [display](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2/blob/master/actions/display.js) actions
- All [layers](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2/blob/master/actions/layers.js) actions
- All [locate](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2/blob/master/actions/locate.js) actions
- All [map](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2/blob/master/actions/map.js) actions
- All [task](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2/blob/master/actions/task.js) actions
- All [theme](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2/blob/master/actions/theme.js) actions
- All [windows](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2/blob/master/actions/windows.js) actions
- Additional API calls:
  - `window.qwc2.addExternalLayer(resource, beforeLayerName=null)`
  - `window.qwc2.drawScratch(geomType, message, drawMultiple, callback, style = null)`

See the docstrings in [API.js](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2/blob/master/plugins/API.jsx) as well as the actions functions linked above for more information.

See [api_examples.js](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/static/api_examples.js) for some concrete examples.
